### 1. User Efficiency: 
Our proposed Alexa skill is an alternative to other existing solutions and should be more convenient
### 2. Usefulness:
The Alexa skill is a tool to improve responsibility sharing and should solve the problem in a useful manner
### 3. Learnability:
Learnability is highly valued because User Efficiency hinges on the ability for our users to quickly learn this application.
### 4. Reliability: 
While robustness is important for voice interactions, designing the system to be reliable ensures robustness in the skill.
### 5. Robustness: 
With the Amazon Echo, the voice interactions must be robust in order to reduce frustration and heartbreak and efficiently interpret commands
### 6. Verifiability: 
User requires feedback to know the app has registered user input and is working as expected.
### 7. Maintainability: 
Since the current idea of the app is pretty simple, it is important to make our code maintainable for any future improvements; correctness then becomes part of maintainability.
### 8. Correctness: 
While correctness is valued, we placed it below maintainability because our app works on the net so deploying changes would be easy.
### 9. Performance:
 Our projected data/user size is relatively small and hence not performance intensive. 
### 10. Accessibility: 
App is fundamentally based on userâ€™s speech and hearing ability.
### 11. Interoperability: 
Standard interaction is basic commands to operate the device. We do not have to worry much about standard dialect.
### 12. Portability: 
We have no intention of making this work on Siri or Cortana
### 13. Reusability: 
The skill has no complicated components that would be useful in other formats
### 14. Security: 
The skill does not contain sensitive information and Alexa already has security measures implemented by Amazon. Security is the least important quality among 14 qualities
